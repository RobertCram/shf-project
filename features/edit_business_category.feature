  PT: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/135009339


  Background:
    Given the following users exists
      | email                | admin |
      | applicant@random.com |       |
      | admin@shf.com        | true  |

    And the following business categories exist
      | name         | description                     |
      | dog grooming | grooming dogs from head to tail |
      | dog crooning | crooning to dogs                |


  Scenario: Admin wants to edit a business category
    Given I am logged in as "admin@shf.com"
    And I am on the "business categories" page
    And I click the t("business_categories.index.edit") action for the row with "dog grooming"
    Then I should see t("business_categories.edit.title", category_name: "dog grooming")
    And I fill in t("activerecord.attributes.business_category.name") with "doggy grooming"
    And I click on t("business_categories.edit.submit_button_label")
    Then I should see t("business_categories.update.success")
    And I should see "doggy grooming"


  Scenario: Admin makes a mistake when editing a business category = sad path
    Given I am logged in as "admin@shf.com"
    And I am on the "business categories" page
    Then I should see "dog crooning"
    And I should see "dog grooming"
    And I click the t("business_categories.index.edit") action for the row with "dog crooning"
    Then I should see t("business_categories.edit.title", category_name: "dog crooning")
    And I fill in t("activerecord.attributes.business_category.name") with ""
    And I click on t("business_categories.edit.submit_button_label")
    Then I should see error t("activerecord.attributes.business_category.name") t("errors.messages.blank")

  Scenario: A non-admin user cannot edit business categories
    Given I am logged in as "applicant@random.com"
    And I navigate to the business category edit page for "dog grooming"
    Then I should see t("errors.not_permitted")

  Scenario: A visitor cannot edit business categories
    Given I am Logged out
    And I navigate to the business category edit page for "dog grooming"
    Then I should see t("errors.not_permitted")
